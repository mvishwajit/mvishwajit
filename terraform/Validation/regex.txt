The regexall function is used to check whether the var.resource_group_name variable matches the regular expression ^[a-zA-Z0-9]{5}$, which matches strings consisting of exactly 5 alphanumeric characters. The length function is then used to count the number of matches, and the entire condition is true if and only if the length is equal to 1.

In other words, this condition is checking whether the var.resource_group_name variable is exactly 5 alphanumeric characters long. If it is, the condition is true and the resource will be created or updated. If it is not, the condition is false and an error message will be displayed.

Note that the regular expression used in this condition only allows alphanumeric characters (uppercase and lowercase letters and digits). If you need to allow additional characters, you can modify the regular expression accordingly.
